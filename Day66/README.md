### JavaScript closures

- js variables can belong to the local or global scope.

#### What is a closure?

A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer( enclosing ) function's variables-scope chain. The closure has three scope chains:

- access to its own scope(variables defined between its curly brackets)

- access to the outer function's variables

- access to the global variables.
