# Day 7

In Day7, we learn about reserved words in js

## Reserved words

Reserve words are words that you cannot use as identifiers in js.

JavaScript has a number of reserved words that you cannot use as identifiers. Reserved words have a specific meaning to the js language, as they are part of the language syntax. Using a reserved word causes a compilation error when loading your script.

Ex:
> break, delete, function, return, typeof, case, do, if, switch, var, catch, else, in, this, void, continue, false, instanceof, throw, while, debugger, finally, new, true, with, default, for, null, try

### Future reserved words

A future reserved word does not yet have a special meaning, unlike a keyword, but is still reserved by the standard and thus is not a valid identifier. The stated reason for this is that the words are used as keywords in proposed extensions and are therfore reserved to allow for the possibility of future adoption of those extensions. 

> class, const, enum, export, extends, import, super

### Strict mode future reserved words

The following are also future reserved words when encountered within strict mode code. 

> implements, let, private, public, yield, interface, package, protected, static

### Reserved words in ECMAScript

Es is a standard. JS is a dialect of ES
> export, import, private, synchronied, char, interface, public, transient, const, float
