### Iterating arrays

Js for loops iterate over each item in an array.
js arrays are zero based, which means the first item is referenced with an index of 0.

Referencing items in arrays is done with a numeric index, starting at zero and ending with the array length minus 1. The syntax to access an array member

for(initialization; condition; final expression){
    //code to be executed
}

for loop statement uses three expressions: the initialization, the condition, and the final expression. The final expression is executed at the end of each loop execution. It is commonly used to increment the index.
