Conditional Statements(switch)in Js

## Switch Statement

- switch statement is used to perform different conditions. use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

syntax:

switch(expressiion){
    case x:
    break;
    case y:
    break;
    default:
    //code block
}

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- if there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

## Break Keyword
when js reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of inside the block.

## Default keyword
The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match
